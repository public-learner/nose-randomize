nose-randomize
==============

A plugin to allow nose to run tests in a random order

This work is based on the code created by Charles McCreary as posted to https://code.google.com/p/python-nose/issues/detail?id=255

This project is attempting the following:
 * "proper" plugin structure
 * The ability to randomize across all tests, not just within the TestCase class
